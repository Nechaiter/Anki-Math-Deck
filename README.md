## About Duplicates

When using Anki's "Find Duplicates" feature, you may see cards flagged as duplicates by name. Most of these are actually different cards with the same name, but a few are true duplicates (same name and content) that the script did not filter out. Sorry for this inconvenience, there are only a few, and you can easily review them using Anki's `duplicates` tag.
